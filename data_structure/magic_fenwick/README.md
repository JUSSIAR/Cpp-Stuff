# Fenwick tree realization in special case
> This code contains only the structure

### Points
- amortized algorithm
- works with the complexity of a regular array, if you do not use additional functionality
- works in logarithmic time using up to functionality
- has an implementation of the sum on a sub-segment of the array for logarithmic complexity
- the amount on the segment is implemented using the operator ()
- template structure

### For using this structure
- #include 
- - iostream
- - vector
- - algorithm
- using std::vector;
- using std::size_t;
- using std::sort;
- using std::reverse;
